# Notice-Board-using-Assembly
A college Notice board made using x86 microcontroller assembly language programming.

<b>Objective of the Project</b>
<br>
 <i>The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a
 PC-based notice board using an 8051 microcontroller. This system aims
 to modernize information sharing in various settings such as
 educational institutions, offices, or public spaces by replacing traditional
 physical notice boards with a digital, easily updatable alternative.</i>
 
 <b>Project Motivation</b>
 <br>
<i> In today's fast-paced digital world, the need for quick and efficient
 information dissemination is crucial. Traditional notice boards are often
 overlooked and require manual updates, which can be time-consuming
 and inefficient. By creating a PC-based notice board, we address these
 issues, providing a solution that allows for real-time updates, increased
 visibility, and improved information management. This project also
 serves as an excellent opportunity to apply our knowledge of
 microcontroller programming and interfacing in a practical, real-world
 scenario.</i>

 <b> Use Case </b>
 <br>
<i> Real-time message display without manual input.</i>

<b>Application</b>
<br>
<i>Useful in schools, offices, and public places.</i>
